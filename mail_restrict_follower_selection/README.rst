This module was written to allow you to restrict the selection of possible
followers. For example, if you use the social ERP functions only internally,
it makes sense to filter possible followers for being employees. Otherwise,
you'll get a quite crowded list of partners to choose from.

Moreover, the module disables the option to automatically add followers that
do not meet the domain.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to `System parameters` and adjust
`mail_restrict_follower_selection.domain` as you see fit. This restricts
followers globally, if you want to restrict only the followers for a certain
record type (or have different restrictions for different record types),
create a parameter `mail_restrict_follower_selection.domain.$your_model`.

As an example, you could use `[('category_id.name', '=', 'Employees')]` to allow
only contacts with 'Employees' tag to be added as follower - this also is
the default.

Note: This module won't change existing followers!
